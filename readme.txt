== Description ==

AMP pages are used by most search engines to show your website pages to mobile searchers. **They are the first contact many users will have with your web site**, and a large part of your search results will depend on how attractive and interactive your AMP pages are.

weeblrAMP goes well beyond standard AMP plugins. It lets you create a nearly complete AMP version of your site, as fully featured as the AMP specification allows: **posts, pages, categories, tags and archives**. Also built-in: ** comments (native and Disqus), Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel, ads, schema.org, Yoast, Jetpack, Beaver Builder, Elementor or PolyLang integrations. Translated to French and Spanish.**.

The premium edition **automatically converts Contact Forms 7, Gravity forms and WPForms forms, Mailchimp For WP, WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads** and adds many other features. 

weeblrAMP will operate out of the box with default settings and is **highly customizable from WordPress admin**. 

Developers can override every bit of the AMP pages with **templates overrides**, as well as its **70+ filters and actions**, **fully documented on our site**. 

Want to see it in action on a site with WooCommerce, Gravity Forms or Contact Forms 7 (and more)? please visit our [demonstration site](https://demo.weeblrpress.com/amp/).
